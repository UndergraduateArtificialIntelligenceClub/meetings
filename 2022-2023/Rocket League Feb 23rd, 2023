## Present
- Paul
- Taran
- Jacob

## Status of everybody
- Very little overall
- Eager to learn

## Next Steps
Very open-minded, not many desires as to what to achieve.

	- Try different model types / reward functions
- 

### Jacob's Ideas
- Look into Cybera?
- Look into transformers
	- Library `HuggingFace`.
- 


### Taran's Ideas
- Go through existing repositories, figure out what they're doing.


### Craig
- Not present, maybe build models overnight?


## Long Term / Goals
- Portfolio project
- Some wrapped up around May.
	- "Wrapped up" here means able to play at a relatively high level.
	- Possibly on the central repository for RL bots.
- Learning-based is more long-term, likely do experimentation over the summer.
- Who knows: maybe Programmatic Strategies.
