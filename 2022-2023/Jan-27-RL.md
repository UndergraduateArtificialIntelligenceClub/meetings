## Change in Direction
In the previous meeting, glorious leader (me) focused too much on the models being built and not enough on ensuring the data was there to put into the models (it wasn't).
As a change of pace, we are now going to get RLGym set up as our first foray into the world of RL bots. 
https://rlgym.org/

## Tasks for the coming week
- Try and get RLGym up and running. This will likely requre installing several additional programs
    - Install Rocket League, if you haven't already. Its free through the Epic Games Launcher: https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/rocket-league
    - BakkesMod: https://bakkesmod.com/
    - rlgym (above)
    - rlbot: https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=rlbot&atb=v195-1

At this point, we are just making sure that we all can install this and get something up and running. This will help as we move towards more experimentation / individual work.

If you want, try and make some progress on a bot! If you do, please write down any experiments or things you learned!
