# Rocket League
Members are able to get the RLGym program up and running (yay!)
Discussion was primarily focused on what types of rewards to consider.
- X position of the ball (further downfield, the better)
- Goals (obviously)
- Distance from our own goal.

We'll regroup in 2 weeks since most people are quite busy with midterms. Next week will be a quick discussion about what we did this week, then continue on until the 17th.
