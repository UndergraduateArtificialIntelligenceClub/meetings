# Meeting #1 September 27, 2019, Peter, Justin, Paul, Jawad and Giancarlo present

## Open Vacany (Vice President)

+ Sherry switched universities so now there's a new exec position open.

+ We have temporarily appointed Jawad as a replacement until elections are held.
+ There will be a nomination form so people can put in their name if they want to run for the position.

## Commitees Involvment

+ There are many commitees you can join.

+ The main ones are the website commitee & newsletter commitee. There is also the presentations commitee that you can get involved in.

+ Talk to any of the execs (gino knows what's going one for all of them) to get started!

## Joining GitHub Organization

+ We have a GitHub so join it!

+ Right now, you'll have to send your github username to @gino on slack so it can be manually added.

## Speakers Series Update

people would prefer to have the last talk on Nov 7

## Miscellaneous

We are probably going to start a basic started project up real soon.
We'll be using the MNIST data set to do digit recognition!
