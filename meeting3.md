Got to meet Dr. Schaefer

###### ps: I typed *VERY* fast so except some typos

He talked about ddep learning being very important to the future of Machine Learning, but has it's problems.
It's a flash in the pan. IT's temporary until a better solution is found.
Says he can help us gets speakers to talk about fields in AI.
We need a reason to get people into AI.
It's critical for people to have a good reason to show up.
The second thing he thinks is imprtant is to think about projects to get people involved.
It might be a good idea to talk the things peopole are intersted in and make a problem to get people working on it to get their hands dirty.
At the end there could be a competition. Good learning experience.
Basically have a mini hackathon.
Give a problem but don't say how to solve it so people will explore different ideas.
Talked about a contest he once held with his class with a modified FIFA game.

Nick proposed starting with somehing very low level that most can accomplish.

Thinking about starting to plan for next year.

We can get a lot more people through the high level talks.

Another possiblity instead of a game is to take a data set and make a prediction. It's easy to set up. There are lots of option as a first phase.

He told us to not sell ourselves short. Sometimes people who are not aware of background can find a new solution to an old problem. Bias is a very big problem in AI. Doesn't mean the problem has been solved that we can't make a contribution.
