# Recap of what we've already done
 - Presentation schedule for next sem is prepared
 - Rough outline of what we want for the tournament repository

# Game tournament
Hex was chosen for this semester. More people are familiar with it and it has
more research papers that the others, so it'll likely attract the most interest

We're planning to make a basic repository for the tournament, that way teams
have a starting point

 - **Guidelines and documentation:** Project documentation and a clear
   description of how to start
 - **Basic tests:** Since teams don't have to use python, we want to have some
   sanity checks for teams to make sure their bots aren't completely wrong.
   Things like ensuring a bot makes legal moves, can determine when the game is
   over, and can communicate through whichever protocol we choose in the end
 - **A basic bot:** A very basic reference template, likely in python, of what a
   functioning bot needs. We'll start by implementing just a random guess bot.
   If this isn't enough, especially for beginners, we might have it do some
   rudimentary n-step searches

Tasks:
 * Documentation: Gino
 * Test cases: Paul, Justin
 * Basic bot: Saakshi, Vova

# Schedule
Presentations after reading week in the first semester will likely be closer to
status updates for teams' projects than lectures. We're leaving this time
flexible for now, so we can adapt things during the semester

Instead of finishing all the presentations before semester starts, we'll start
working on presentations about 1 month in advance. This'll make us a bit more
flexible

# For next week
Everyone should start slowly on their assigned tasks. Nothing major needs to be
achieved, just better to get back into the habit and figure out how much needs
to be done

We should also really figure out the bot's protocol, otherwise all the
tournament repository teams are stuck

# Other things to think about
 * Possibly transition from Slack to Discord... Depending on how hard that is
 * Week of welcome???
 * Update people's profiles on website
 * Revise and get somewhat familiar with website codebase
