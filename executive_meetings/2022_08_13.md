## GovLab
Provides opportunities for recent graduates and undergrads to get involved in AI

Will likely be there in the first intro meeting, helping us introduce the club

Still doing Rocket League bot for club fair. We also obtained our club poster
and stickers again

Reorganized presentation schedule:
 - Rust in AI presentation
 - Split git and python environments presentations
 - Neural net presentation has turned into a AI libraries (numpy, pandas...)

## Tournament
There was a huge rewrite of our testing and bot spec. The code is more simple
and has better commenting now
