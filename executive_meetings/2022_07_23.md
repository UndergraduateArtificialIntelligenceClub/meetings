## Club fair
We're looking into [SerpentAI](https://github.com/SerpentAI/SerpentAI) as an
alternative to our previous AIGym plans. This framework is more general, not
specific to Rocket League, and we're thinking it'd be cooler to present a model
we wrote ourselves

If this takes too long, the fallback plan is still using the pre-trained AIGym
Rocket League one

## Tournament
Tournament submission deadline has been moved up to right after November reading
week, to not be in conflict with finals and Christmas

We're continuing to look for sponsors, though it's not absolutely critical to
have them

## Bot problems
Our bot specification has a gaping flaw with the `show_board` debugging command.
Since there's no standardized way to display the board, and it doesn't make
sense to have one, there's no telling how many lines to read. Our current
solutions:

 - Specify a special character, say `=` to mark the end of output
 - Print the board to stderr instead
 - Set a 3s time limit on printing, then just grab everything from the output in
   that time
