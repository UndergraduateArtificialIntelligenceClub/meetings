# Club fair
We're considering using OpenAI Gym, or RL Gym, to get a Rocket League RL bot
running for the fair. Something visual like that works well

It might be better to attend the UCS club fair instead of the general club fair.
It'll cost less and will be more targeted towards our audience. We need to
figure out what type of a club fair they're hosting first, though the RL bot
will probably fit in any case

# In progress
 - Hex bot going nicely, we just need some testing
 - Find sponsors for tournament
 - Update site?
 - Starting to finalize presentation schedule
 - TODO: Check if we can still use the opening presentation
