## Club fair
We're getting posters up for our first meeting, Friday September 9th @ 4pm.
Everyone should come! There'll likely even be pizza!

The cs club fair looks like a one-day one-afternoon thing, which might be a bit
restrictive for a lot of people, so we're betting on those posters to draw in
the crowds. We'll have an external monitor set up for the Rocket League bot too

We're still confirming if the SIC will be available on Fridays at 4

Paul has made beautiful introductory slides already

## Projects
The hex bot tests have been improved over the last week. This week we're looking
to revise the documentation and in-line comments to make the project easier to
read for beginners

We'll update the website as soon as we get confirmation about SIC booking times
