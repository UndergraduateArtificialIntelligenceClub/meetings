# Club fair
We're participating in the UACS club fair, as it'll have people who're more
interested in what we're doing. It's also cheaper. This year it looks like a
booth-like fair, so we're continuing to prepare an RL gym bot

Instead of training on our computers for 1-2 days, it may be easier to just use
a pre-trained model [like this one](https://github.com/Rolv-Arild/Necto). We
will showcase it training further at the fair

# Tournament
We should also consider setting something up about the tournament for the club
fair. Presenting our random Hex bot, explaining how Hex works and giving
attendees a feel for how they could put on together would be helpful

We're looking to get some companies involved in the tournament. VP external and
Treasurer will be looking into that. Our goal is ~$100 as a first place prize,
~$50 for second and ~$25 for third. All in gift cards. Prizes less than that may
not interest people enough

Our website also needs to be updated to show information about the tournament

The demo bot and central program should be done by the end of next week

# ProjectX
We have again been invited to ProjectX, though we probably won't be doing it
this year

ProjectX is a competition hosted out of UofT for machine learning research.
Groups have to do original research and write up a paper on the matter that's
submitted for review. Since we already have several things going on, we'll only
do it if more people express interest
