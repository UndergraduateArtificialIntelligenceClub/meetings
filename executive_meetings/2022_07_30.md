## Club fair
SerpentAI turns out to be mostly a framework for single player games. It
essentially processes the image into sprite coordinates and feeds that to the
program. This may be less interesting that what AIGym has to offer, so we're
leaning towards our previous Rocket League idea

Gino found a lot of old materials for the club fair. We have posters stickers
and other merch

## Tournament
We found the issue causing git to seemingly recommit entire files. Windows
machines need to make sure to use dos2unix or a similar program to remove the
return carriage at the end of every line that Windows inserts into files
