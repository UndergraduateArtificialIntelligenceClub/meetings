# Choosing games

The ideal game should:

 - Has easily adjustable difficulty. Ex: increasing the board size
 - Easy to implement a simple bot for it, 1-3h
 - Has some research papers we could try to implement
 - Finishing one turn and one game shouldn't take too long
 - Fun!

We came up with a list of games that roughly fall into 3 categories:

 - Simple: Ultimate tic tac toe, Gomoku, Go
 - Identical moves: Shoubu, Abalone, Hex
 - Various moves: Chess, Quoridor, Sprouts

The ones in the "Identical moves" category generally received the most interest.
They also most closely fit the requirements. The "Simple" category fits most as
well, though didn't receive as much interest

Attending members agreed to look further into the games they were most
interested in. We'll try to have a vote sometime in the next few weeks

# Scheduling

We realized it may be inconvenitent to have the tournament right before or
during exam period. One possible solution may be to have it at the start of
winter term. That way teams can work on it after exams and not add stress to
their workload at the end of the term

Other scheduling stuff remained the same
