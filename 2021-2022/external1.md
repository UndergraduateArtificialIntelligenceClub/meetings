# NetX - July 22nd, 2021
*Giancarlo present*

NetX is a 2 day conference/network/case competition event.

Days are broken into
1. Conference / Networking. Listen to talks, network with sponsors and other students.
2. The case competition itself

Winners from each case competition get internship spots and close contenders get interviews.

## What they want from us
We promote NetX on our slack, retweet/share on our social media.

## What we get in return
They'll promote our events to all their attendants.
This only really benefits us if we keep our initial workshops for the month of September (maybe even October) online.
We might be forced to do that either way depending on how the SIC decides to reopen.
